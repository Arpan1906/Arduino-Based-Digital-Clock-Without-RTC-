# Arduino-Based-Digital-Clock-Without-RTC-
The following project demonstrates "A Real-Time Digital Clock" built using Arduino Uno R3, a 16x2 LCD display, and push buttons—no RTC module required. The project uses Arduino’s internal timing and interrupts to display accurate time and allows manual time setting via buttons. Simple, reliable, and fully customizable. I hope this will be helpful..
